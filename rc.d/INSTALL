Install /etc/rc.d symlinks


Use update-rc.d to install rc.d symlinks:
  update-rc.d - install and remove System-V style init script links

update-rc.d  updates  the  System V style init script links /etc/rcrun‚Äê
level.d/NNname whose target  is  the  script  /etc/init.d/name.   These
links  are  run  by  init when it changes runlevels; they are generally
used to start and stop system services such as  daemons.   runlevel  is
one  of the runlevels supported by init, namely, 0123456789S, and NN is
the two-digit sequence number that determines  where  in  the  sequence
init will run the scripts.
