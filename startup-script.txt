Startup script


In a nutshell, if you want to create a startup script for a new service:

o Write a shell script in /etc/init.d.  This script must accept one
  argument which may be start, stop, force-reload, restart, or
  (optional) reload or status.  The difference between reload and
  restart is that restart is equivalent to stop followed by start
  while reload reloads the configuration without stopping anything
  (if the service supports it); force-reload does reload if available
  and restart otherwise.  See the existing files and Making scripts
  run at boot time with Debian for examples.

o Run update-rc.d to create symbolic links to start and stop your
  service. Most services run in runlevels 2, 3, 4 and 5.[1]
