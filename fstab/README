fstab.txt
  The fstab (/etc/fstab) (or file systems table) file is a
  system configuration file on Debian systems.  The fstab file
  typically lists all available disks and disk partitions, and
  indicates how they are to be initialized or otherwise
  integrated into the overall system's file system.
