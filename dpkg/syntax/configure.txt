dpkg --configure -a

Used to reconfigure dpkg if dpkg was interrupted.

"E: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'sudo dpkg --configure -a'
to correct the problem."

This error is actually telling you exactly what is wrong: dpkg was
interrupted as a result the package was not configured correctly.

Run the command it tells you to sudo dpkg --configure -a and it should
be able to correct itself.

If it doesn't try running sudo apt-get install -f(to fix broken packages)
and then try running sudo dpkg --configure -a again.

Just make sure you have internet access available so that you can download
any dependencies.

{edit} These instructions may not work if by upgrade you meant
apt-get dist-upgrade if you were trying to do a distribution
upgrade (i.e. 11.10->12.04) then you will need to edit your question
to reflect that.
