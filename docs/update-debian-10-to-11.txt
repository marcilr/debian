I have a new 2TB Crucial MX500 2.5 inch solid state
to build up a new workstation.  This is likely the best
means of backup and duplication.

New system name?  Always did like the name covellite.
    
Need to cut a Debian 11 Bullseye to a usb key to install
new covellite system.



Upgrade Debian 10 to Debian 11 Bullseye
=======================================
The procedure is as follows:
1. Backup the system.

i. Inspect version of linux:
$ lsb_release -a
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID:	Debian
Description:	Debian GNU/Linux 10 (buster)
Release:	10
Codename:	buster


ii. Plugged in the stray Samsung USB SSD drive that mount as:

$ mount | grep T7
/dev/sdb1 on /media/marcilr/T7 type fuseblk \
(rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,user_id=0,group_id=0,\
default_permissions,allow_other,blksize=4096,uhelper=udisks2)

$ df -h | grep T7
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
...
/dev/sdb1       466G  249G  218G  54% /media/marcilr/T7
..

iii.
Inspect volumes:
$ df -h
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
udev            7.8G     0  7.8G   0% /dev
tmpfs           1.6G  9.3M  1.6G   1% /run
/dev/sda2        92G   61G   27G  70% /
tmpfs           7.8G   24M  7.8G   1% /dev/shm
tmpfs           5.0M  4.0K  5.0M   1% /run/lock
tmpfs           7.8G     0  7.8G   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
/dev/sda1       511M   86M  426M  17% /boot/efi
/dev/sda4        92G   33G   54G  38% /usr/local
/dev/sda5        92G   70G   17G  81% /usr/local/VirtualBox_VMs
/dev/sda6       288G   50G  223G  19% /usr/local/VirtualBox_VMs2
tmpfs           1.6G   28K  1.6G   1% /run/user/1000
/dev/sdb1       466G  249G  218G  54% /media/marcilr/T7

7.8 + 61 + 7.8 + 33 + 70 + 50 = 220.6G


Looks like the Samsung ssd has 218G of 466G free.



2. Update existing packages and reboot the Debian 10 system.

3. Edit the file /etc/apt/sources.list using a text editor and 
replace each instance of buster with bullseye.  Next find the 
security line, replace keyword buster/updates with bullseye-security.

4. Update the packages index on Debian Linux, run:
    sudo apt update

5. Prepare for the operating system upgrade, run:
sudo apt upgrade

6. Finally, update Debian 10 to Debian 11 bullseye by running:
sudo apt full-upgrade

7. Reboot the Linux system so that you can boot into Debian 11 Bullseye

8. Verify that everything is working correctly.

Let us see all commands step by step to upgrade Debian 10 Buster 
to Debian 11 Bullseye safetly running in the cloud or bare metal 
environment.
Step 1. Backup your system

Warning! Do not skip the backup step. The author and nixCraft are 
not responsible for data loss and failed installation.

It is crucial to back up all data and system configurations. 
Cloud-based VMs can be quickly backup and restore using snapshots. 
I use rsnapshot, which is the perfect solution for making backups 
on the local or remote servers. Check os version in Linux:

lsb_release -a

Here is what I see:

No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID:	Debian
Description:	Debian GNU/Linux 10 (buster)
Release:	10
Codename:	buster

Note down the Linux kernel version too:
uname -mrs

My Linux kernel version:

Linux 4.19.0-18-amd64 x86_64

Also note down the Debian version:
cat /etc/debian_version
10.11
Step 2. Update ALL existing installed packages

Before you upgrade your Debian version to 11, you must apply all security patches and pending upgrades to Debian 10 itself. Therefore, type the following apt command or apt-get command:
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt full-upgrade
sudo apt --purge autoremove

OR
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get full-upgrade
sudo apt-get --purge autoremove

Reboot the Debian 10.x buster to apply the kernel and other updates:
sudo systemctl reboot
Step 3. Update /etc/apt/sources.list file

Make sure you replace http://mirrors.linode.com/ APT URL mirror name with your actual mirror name.

Before starting the upgrade procedure, you must reconfigure APTâ€™s source-list files. To view current settings using the cat command or more command
more /etc/apt/sources.list

Old Debian 10 APT config file:

deb http://deb.debian.org/debian buster main
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian buster main
 
deb http://security.debian.org/debian-security buster/updates main
deb-src http://security.debian.org/debian-security buster/updates main
 
# buster-updates, previously known as 'volatile'
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian buster-updates main
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian buster-updates main

Old Debian 10.x /etc/apt/sources.list file

The keyword buster indicates that we are using an older version 10. Hence, we must change all the references in this file from Buster to Bullseye using a text editor such as vim:
vi /etc/apt/sources.list

I prefer to use sed tool, but first backup all config files using the cp command:
sudo cp -v /etc/apt/sources.list /root/
sudo cp -rv /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ /root/

Edit the /etc/apt/sources.list file:
sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list

Find the debian-security line for Buster:
deb http://mirrors.linode.com/debian-security buster/updates main

Replace with:
deb http://mirrors.linode.com/debian-security bullseye-security main

OR the following syntax is valid too:
deb http://mirrors.linode.com/debian-security bullseye-security/updates main

Then replace other buster line with bullseye in /etc/apt/sources.list and /etc/apt/sources.list.d/* directory. For example, find:
deb http://mirrors.linode.com/debian buster main

Replace with:
deb http://mirrors.linode.com/debian bullseye main

See updated file now:
cat /etc/apt/sources.list
