  updatedb [OPTION]...

  updatedb creates or updates a database used by locate(1).  If the database 
  already exists, its data is reused to avoid rereading directories that have 
  not changed.

  updatedb is usually run daily by cron(8) to update the default database.
  --updatedb - update a database for mlocate
