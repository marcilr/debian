sudo, sudoedit â€” execute a command as another user


Enable 'sudo' for user account

1. Become superuser:
$ su root

2. Install sudo:
# aptitude install sudo
# type sudo
sudo is /usr/bin/sudo
#

Looks good.

3. Add user account to the group sudo:
# adduser remarcil sudo
The user `remarcil' is already a member of `sudo'.
#

Looks like I did this already.

4. Now, log out and then log in with the same user.

5. Open a terminal and execute:
$ sudo echo "Hello, world!"

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

[sudo] password for remarcil: 
Hello, world!
$

If all goes well you'll see on screen Hello, world!

Looks good.
