updatedb
========
updatedb [OPTION]...

updatedb creates or updates a database used by locate(1).  If the database 
already exists, its data is reused to avoid rereading directories that have 
not changed.

updatedb is usually run daily by cron(8) to update the default database.
--updatedb - update a database for mlocate
  https://manpages.debian.org/buster/mlocate/updatedb.8.en.html

locate
======
locate [OPTION]... PATTERN...

locate reads one or more databases prepared by updatedb(8) and writes 
file names matching at least one of the PATTERNs to standard output, 
one per line.

If --regex is not specified, PATTERNs can contain globbing characters. 
If any PATTERN contains no globbing characters, locate behaves as if 
the pattern were *PATTERN*.

By default, locate does not check whether files found in database still 
exist (but it does require all parent directories to exist if the database 
was built with --require-visibility no). locate can never report files 
created after the most recent update of the relevant database.
--locate - find files by name
