Configure PATH for all users


The first place where PATH is set is /etc/login.defs.  There's a
setting for root and a setting for everyone else.

Another place where you can define environment variables is
/etc/environment.  These settings will apply to everyone (you
can't write arbitrary shell code there).

A third place where you can define environment variables is
/etc/profile.  There you can write arbitrary shell code. If you
want a user-specific setting, there is the corresponding per-user
file ~www-data/.profile.  But this will only apply to console
interactive logins; in particular it won't apply to cron jobs
unless they explicitly source /etc/profile.

If you only need that PATH setting in a user crontab, you can
write it at the beginning of the crontab. Note that you need the
full list (PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/zend/bin),
you can't use a variable substitution (PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/zend/bin
won't work there).
