Virtual Install




Fri Jan 11 07:28:15 AST 2019
============================
o Need to increase size of debian desktop in VMware.
This is accomplished via VMware Tools


o Installed VMware Tools to Debian 9.x 64-bit machine.


1. In VMWare, with Debian 9.x 64-bit machine running.
Observe:
  VMware Tools enables many features and improves mouse movement,
  video and performance.  Log in to the guest operating system 
  and click "Install Tools".

  Logged into Debian 9.2 64-bit machine

  click Install Tools button in lower right

2. Logged into Debian 9.x 64-bit machine observed:
/media/cdrom/VMwareTools-10.3.2-9925305.tar.gz

Installed with:
# cd ~
# mkdir tmp; cd tmp
# tar zxvpf /media/cdrom/VMwareTools-10.3.2-9925305.tar.gz
# cd vmware-tools-distrib/
# ./vmware-install.pl
open-vm-tools packages are available from the OS vendor and VMware recommeneds
using open-vm-tools packages. See http://kb.vmware.com/kb/2073803 for more
information.
Do you still want to proceed with this installation [no] <enter>

INPUT: [no]  default
#

Installed debian open-vm-tools package:

# aptitude install open-vm-tools
The following NEW pacakges will be installed:
  ethtool{a} fuse{a} libdumbnet1{a} libmspack0{a} libxerces-c3.1{a}
  libxml-security-c17v5{a} open-vm-tools zerofree{a}
0 packages upgraded, 8 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded
Need to get 1,933 kB of archives.  After unpacking 7,763 kB will be used.

Installed without issue. Restarted:
# shutdown -r now

3. After restart under VMware Tools on machine desktop ran run_upgrade.sh
via shell
# cd ~
# mkdir tmp; cd tmp
# cp /media/cdrom/* .
# ./run_upgrader.sh
# shutdown -r now

This likely ran the vmware-tools-upgrader-64 that was copied from /media/cdrom/


o Updated /etc/apt/sources.list, updated package manager, 
  the updated:

In /etc/apt/sources.list commented out cd used for installation:
  # deb cdrom:[Debian GNU/Linux 9.2.1 Stretch_ - Official amd64 xfce-CD \
  Binary-1 20171013-13:08/ startch main

Updated with the standard stretch free and non-free sources:
  deb http://deb.debian.org/debian stretch main
  deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian stretch main

  deb http://deb.debian.org/debian-security/ stretch/updates main
  deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian-security/ stretch/updates main

  deb http://deb.debian.org/debian stretch-updates main contrib non-free
  deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian stretch-updates main contrib non-free

--SourcesList
  https://wiki.debian.org/SourcesList


Then updated:
  # apt-get update

Install aptitude:
  # apt-get install aptitude
  
Finally updated and upgrade:
  # aptitude update
  # aptitude upgrade
  # sync
  # ldconfig

This updated to:
  # cat /etc/debian_version
  9.6
  #

Looks good!


o Installation of debian-9.2.1-amd64-xfce-CD-1.iso to 
virtual machine Debian 9.x 64-bit under VMware finally worked.

# cat /etc/debian_version
9.1
